# Intro Component With Sign-up Form👨‍💻

## Project Overview 🌟

This is a front-end coding challenge completed for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The challenge was to build an intro component with sign-up form and make it look as close to the provided design as possible.

## Technologies Used 💻

- HTML
- CSS

### The Challenge 📋

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
- Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
